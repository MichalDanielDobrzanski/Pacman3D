# Pacman3D

A C++ game based on OpenGL written in Visual Studio.

This is my project for university assignment. I was able to implement original ghost movement algorithms and orignal decision making.
The game is not fully finished as it needs to have its gameplay written (starting menu / interaction between ghost and a Pacman / Pacman model).

Any pull requests are highly welcome!

General information:
1. C++ / Visual Studio 2012
2. Uses oldschool OpenGL techniques ( I guess it is around 1.5 - as I was obliged to do so for this assignment)

Controls:
* arrows - Pacman movement
* w,s - camera movement up/down
* a,d - camera movement left/right
* c - follow Pacman mode
* r,f - zoom in/out

OpenGL functionality:
1. vertex arrays
2. texturing
3. modelling
4. basic lighting
